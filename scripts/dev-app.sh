# scripts/dev-app.sh — launch CovenCave in Tauri dev mode.
#
# Starts (or attaches to) the dev server on Cave's DEDICATED dev port, then
# configures Tauri's devUrl to match.
#
# This used to scan 3000..3010 for whatever was free, which meant the address
# depended on what else happened to be running. Now the port is fixed by
# scripts/ports.mjs and a busy port is resolved by identity, not by moving:
#
#   busy, and it answers as Cave  -> attach to it (the common case: you already
#                                    have `pnpm dev` running in another terminal)
#   busy, and it is a stranger    -> refuse, and say what to do about it
#
# Usage:
#   pnpm dev:app                    # attach to, or start, the dev port
#   COVEN_CAVE_PORT=3007 pnpm dev:app   # override the port
#   PORT=3007 pnpm dev:app          # same, honoured second
#   pnpm dev:app -- --release       # forwarded flags to Tauri
