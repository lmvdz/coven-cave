// Repo-wide guard against committed merge-conflict markers.
//
// 23316da3 committed two unresolved conflict blocks into
// src/components/sidebar-minimal.tsx. The file stopped parsing, so every route
// 500'd — including /api/app/build-info — and main stayed broken until
// 4ea88862 (cave-tbdnt / cave-2hh5q). Nothing in the PR gate saw it.
//
// The per-file guards that exist are worth keeping: they name the defect
// precisely for the file they cover. But they only ever protect a file someone
// already thought to protect, which by definition excludes the next file this
// happens to. This is the repo-wide half.

 * Only `<<<<<<<` and `>>>>>>>` trigger a failure, never a bare `=======`.

 * markup, or comment style produces. Seven `=` at the start of a line is: it is
 * a Markdown setext H1 underline, and it also shows up in ASCII rules and
 * banner comments. A real conflict always carries an opening and a closing
 * marker, so dropping the ambiguous one costs no detection while removing the
 * whole false-positive class the bead warned about.
 *
 * Anchoring matters for the same reason — `=======` and `>>>>>>>` both appear
 * mid-line in legitimate code, so an unanchored search is unusable.
