// The familiar's declared identity, assembled into a prompt block.
//
// Prose overview: docs/familiar-identity-context.md
//
// Why this module exists: the Coven identity canon — re-injected on EVERY chat
// turn — asserts that "a familiar's identity is set by its own IDENTITY.md,
// SOUL.md, and role/skill configuration". Until cave-gw3iq that was an unbacked
// promise in chat. Voice (src/lib/voice/hydrate-instructions.ts), the omnigent
// ward preflight, and Familiar Studio all read the contract files; chat did not.
//
// The stale assumption that hid it: chat was believed to pick the files up
// implicitly, because `coven run` boots the harness in the familiar's workspace
// so Codex/Claude would read them off disk. That only holds when NO project root
// is supplied. A chat with a selected project — the normal case — spawns in the
// project root instead, leaving the workspace outside the runtime boundary
// entirely, so no channel ever loaded the files. A user's familiar diagnosed
// exactly this from the inside: it could not read its own SOUL.md and correctly
// refused to invent one.
//
// Assembly here is host-side, in the same category as the operator profile and
// the Knowledge Vault: Cave reads the file and composes the prompt. It does NOT
// widen the familiar's runtime boundary — that boundary governs where a familiar
// may ACT (the daemon's project-root authority over tool calls), never who it
// is. A familiar still cannot open its own SOUL.md with a tool unless the
// workspace is a granted root.
//
// Safeguards, in order of importance:
//
//   1. Slug allow-list. `readFamiliarContractFiles` rejects any id that isn't a
//      strict slug (no separators, no `..`), re-asserted as an inline barrier,
//      so a familiar id can never become an arbitrary-file-read primitive.
//   2. Sentinel defanging. Contract files are writable by the self-improvement
//      loop and arrive with imported familiar packs, so their contents are NOT
//      fully trusted input. Left raw, a file could close this block early and
//      forge a runtime-boundary preamble granting itself roots it was never
//      given. `defangContractSentinels` neutralizes Cave's structural markers.
//   3. Clamps. An oversized file must never crowd out the user's actual message
//      or fail a turn.
//   4. Throw-proof. A missing workspace, unreadable file, or malformed id
//      degrades to no block — never a failed chat turn.
//   5. ward.toml is excluded. It is policy configuration for the contract
//      validator, not persona, and it carries the protected-file list and
//      invariants that exist to constrain self-modification. Feeding those into
//      the prompt would hand the familiar the exact rules meant to bound it.
